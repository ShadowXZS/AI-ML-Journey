This Morning I felt Overwhelmed by simple list. By this Afternoon, I was crushing mathematical loops in "One Go"
The Mornings Failure To Grasp Everything in One go Frustrated me a Lot 
Realized "My Struggle is Just the Brain Downloading the Update"
Message to My Future Self
"Care about the Craft, It brings the best in you"
When I looked at the Clock, Hours had disappeared in the After Noon Session. 
Deep Rest Brings Back the Focus If you ever lost focus Just Sleep it off. 
"I didn't loose time by sleeping; I Invested it."

**"Today, I learned that I don't need to be perfect instantly. I just need to stay at the desk until the logic clicks."
