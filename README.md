## 🌊 Vision
This repository is not static—it is a **living roadmap**.  
- Every commit represents progress.  
- Every project reflects resilience and adaptability.  
- By January 2027, this journey culminates in employment readiness, backed by a portfolio of real-world projects.  

> ⚡ *Note: Projects listed here are initial plans. As I grow, I may add or replace projects to reflect new skills and interests.*  

## 📝 Notes Disclaimer
This repository includes my **complete notes**, linked to my Obsidian vault.  
These notes are a mix of:
- **Technical content**: math, data science, AI/ML concepts, code explanations.  
- **Personal reflections**: motivational entries, reminders, and thoughts written for my future self.  

⚡ **Important**: The personal content is intentional.  
It serves as motivation and resilience tracking throughout my journey.  
Recruiters, mentors, or collaborators are welcome to focus on the technical sections and ignore the personal reflections if they prefer.  

This repo is both a **portfolio** and a **journal of growth** — every commit reflects not just skills, but also the mindset behind them.
