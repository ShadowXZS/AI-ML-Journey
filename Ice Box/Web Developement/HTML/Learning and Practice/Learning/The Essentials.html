      <b>The dog</b>(Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a
      domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is
      derived from extinct gray wolves,[6][7] and the gray wolf is the dog's
      closest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be
      domesticated[9][8] by humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers
      domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago,[7] which was before the
      development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans,
      dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and
      gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
      inadequate for other canids.[11] The dog has been selectively bred over
      millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
      attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They
      perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads,
      protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
      aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted
      to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent
      study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
      "man's best friend".[14]
